"Once there was a sad robot named 'D-PRS-D' who never knew what its purpose was. One day D-PRS-D found a lovely shoe shining machine that went about its day with such glee and joy that it made D-PRS-D want to feel the same way as that happy little shoe shining robot. The shining robot realized D-PRS-D just needed a little bit of purpose so it taught D-PRS-D how to shine shoes also. They became friends and lived happily ever after shining shoe after shoe. The end."
