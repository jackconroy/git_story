"Once there was a sad robot named SADD who never knew what its purpose was. One day SADD found a lovely shoe shining machine that went about its day with such glee and joy that it made SADD want to feel the same way as that happy little boot shining robot. The shining robot realized SADD just needed a little bit of purpose so it taught SADD how to shine boot also. They became friends and lived happily ever after shining boot after boot. The end."
